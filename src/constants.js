  computer: `This is my computer where I do my work. I mostly work in TypeScript and JavaScript but I like learning new languages and frameworks.
      I love building beautiful things that delight users so design principles and UI/UX are also important to me. 
      Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/andria-hibe" target="_blank">Github</a>.`,
  'life-story': `I wasn't always a software engineer. I studied International Relations and started my career in trade policy advocacy and then moved into marketing and events.
  These roles taught me how to analyze complex problems, communicate clearly, and manage projects with diverse teams.
  I now bring that perspective into software development, combining technical skills with strong communication and user empathy.`,
  'sofa-table': `This is my comfy sofa, my favourite spot to relax with a book or dive into one of my hobbies.
  I'm drawn to detail-oriented activities that reward focus and patience and you will often find me working on pottery, miniatures, or embroidery.`,
  tv: `That's my TV. I love watching movies and I'm currently working my way through The Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022 list.
  It's taking a while but I'm enjoying it!`,
  bed: `This is where I sleep. A good night's rest sets me up for the best kind of day. My superpower is being able to sleep anywhere at any time and never having jet lag.`,
  resume: `This is my desk and here you can find my resume. <a href="https://github.com/andria-hibe/resume/blob/dfa375354d0b82e84383bf72485e9d3737360a37/Resume%20-%20Andria%20Hibe.pdf" target="_blank">Have a look!</a>

  project: `This portfolio was made with Kaplay.js, a library for making games in JavaScript. It's my first time using it and it's been a lot of fun learning about it. Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/andria-hibe/2d-portfolio-cottage" target="_blank">Github</a>.`,
  library: `I love reading books. I'm currently reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk and Blindness by Jose Saramago. 
  I'd love to hear if you have any book recommendations.`,
  hobbies: `I love going on adventures, especially through travel and diving trips. I also enjoy hiking, surfing, and skiing whenever I get the chance.
  My latest adventure was a diving liveaboard on the Great Barrier Reef, where I got to witness the migration of dwarf minke whales. When I'm at home, you'll find me obsessing over my plants as I slowly turn my house into a jungle.`,
  refrigerator: `I love baking. If you Google my name, you might just find one of my recipes for brownies that was published in a local magazine. If you work with me, chances are you'll end up with some homemade baked goods at one point or another.`,
