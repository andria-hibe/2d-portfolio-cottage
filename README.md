## 🎮 About

I wanted to try building something I haven't done before and so I made a little 2D game portfolio to showcase who I am.

Explore my cozy cottage and get to know me by interacting with objects. Try it out on both mobile and desktop.

**Built with:**

- 🎮 [Kaplay.js](https://play.kaplayjs.com/) - JavaScript game library
- ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast build tool
